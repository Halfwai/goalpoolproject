                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently there are two different playing options available to you for the coming World Cup. We have our "Classic League", and our "Draft League".
                </p>
                <h3>Classic League</h3>
                <p>
                    Simply pick 10 players that you think will score lots of goals at the World Cup. It's that easy. Once your team is complete you can
                    compare yourself to the rest of our players and compete to be the best in the world. Each round you can make as many transfers as you want,
                     there are no budgeting limitations, just pick the players that you think will score. Once we hit the knock out rounds your team size
                    will be reduced, so pick carefully.
                </p>
                <h3>Draft League</h3>
                <p>
                    Get a bunch or your mates together and set up or join a draft league, all you need is the league code from someone already in the league. Once all
                    the players have been assembled start the draft! Football Goal Pool will assign each player a random draft order, and then the snake draft will commence.
                    You can pick anyone that you want, but be aware that once a team has picked a player, he's theirs for good. Currently there are no transfers available in the
                    draft league, so once your team is picked you can sit back and enjoy the tournement.
